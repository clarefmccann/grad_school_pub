Purpose: Help w/ efficiency of applying to multiple grad schools!

You can clone this repo on your local machine to use for your own applications.

- Step 1: write the "generic" versions of your statement of purpose in the work folder (I have two different versions - (1) a statement of purpose for schools that require a personal history or diversity statement and (2) a statement of purpose for schools that do not require personal history or diversity statements (since there will not be another essay dedicated to explaining my experiences and personal reasons for applying to grad school, i have included bits in this version).
- Step 2: in the blurbs.csv fill you will add your unique school and faculty information
- Step 3: run the script 
- Step 4: breathe, you're almost done :) 

To note: 

- school_1 and school_2 are examples of folders you can create for each school you are applying to. the script will output corresponding statement of purpose's to each school's folder. you can add as many folders/schools as you need!  
- work is where the script, your unique school information, and the generic version(s) of your statement of purpose 
- good luck on your applications and interviews!! you got this <3
